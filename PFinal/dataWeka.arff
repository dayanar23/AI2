Meet the Jackrabbit team with over 10 years in the business Learn more about the Jackrabbit team Can You Afford Class Management Software? Software. Is it worth the monthly cost? This is a question we hear often and hope to give you a few things to consider before you throw the idea out the window. Read More How are you running your business now? How do you store information about students and families? How do you create class schedules? How do you communicate with parents and staff? How do you get paid? How do you track skill progression? These are just 5 questions to think about. we could give you 100, but you would be here all day. What if all these processes could be streamlined? Meaning that they take less time to complete and are more organized than what you have right now. For example, pulling up a student’s file takes about two seconds and only requires one click of the mouse. If you have your information stored in a file cabinet, the time it takes to pull up that file will be much longer. [PS if you can do this under two seconds, please send us a video. We’d love to see someone move that fast.] Priceless. That’s an adjective we hear our customers using to describe our software a lot. Using Jackrabbit has been a game changer for the way they run their business. Their life has freed up and they can focus on what they love. Using online registration, the first year we had twice as many enrollments in half the time – Kelly Gaines In an attempt to show you what priceless may look like for your business, we picked 5 of the biggest benefits you’ll immediately see after implementing the software. The Value Judgment Five simple value points make it obvious that class management software is something that every organization – regardless of size – can benefit from. Jackrabbit has clients with less than 50 customers who see their return on investment come quickly as quickly as those with 2500+ students simply because owners are freed up to follow their passion instead of manage paper rolls and spreadsheets. There are other intangible yet clear benefits: Peace of mind. We’ve not identified what losing a night’s sleep costs you, but we know that you can’t put a dollar value on knowing that the system that keeps your business operational will be working today, tomorrow, next week and next year. Jackrabbit’s goal is to help your head hit your pillow peacefully each night. Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty. We’ve alluded to this and attached what is most likely a grossly underestimated figure to this. But identifying such a metric is quite unique to each organization. It is tremendously important because it underpins your reputation and integrity. It touches on everything from convenience to professionalism to accessibility and is the secret sauce that keeps your customers coming back and attracts new ones to your doorstep. Performance and Results. Again, these details are unique to each organization because your “improvement” is directly tied to your starting point. If you move from a paper system to an electronic, online one, your contrast should be stark. If you’ve already implemented some electronics processes, you will notice improvements for sure, but the contrast you experience may be less shocking. So when asked the question “Can You Afford Class Management Software?” it’s obvious that what you really can’t afford is NOT having it. Proof in the Pudding Our clients are our champions! They state the benefits of using Jackrabbit much more succinctly than we can. “Jackrabbit gives us robust business tools in a system that is geared for our business and that has been important to how efficient we are with it and how much value it brings to us. Our efficiency in scheduling and enrollment has improved dramatically and our parents are thrilled at the convenience and access our online options give them.” David Tait, EVO Swim School “Changing to Jackrabbit has made a big difference in our efficiencies. Automated processes – like online registration – take staff out of the data entry process and gives them more time for interacting on a personal level with families.” Joe Barron, Barron Gymnastics “Jackrabbit is the most powerful system on the market. It saves me time, saves me money, and helps me serve our customers better.” Theresa Case, Piano Central “Jackrabbit saved us from an inefficient software system and has provided us with control over our processes and insight into our information. The value it delivers makes the cost of our previous software seem unjustified! I have become quickly immersed in the value the system provides to us.” Keith Pinkston, New Orleans Dance Academy “Jackrabbit’s portal and online registration have made a big difference with parents. They control their own information and their own destinies because we give them the tools to manage their accounts at the best time and from the best place for them. That is a real differentiator.” Kyle Grussmeyer, All Star Legacy “I praise JR software and database every single day. It’s incredible everything JR allows me to do. I’m sure we cut on a large part time position thanks to it. We have been able to employ additional teachers and develop our classes offer.”Marina Lemaitre, Business Manager, Small World Connect Enrichment Center “Since we started using Jackrabbit Care, we’ve saved so much time and even more-so, stress. Right off the bat, parents expressed their approval. I’ve gotten emails specifically thanking me for allowing online payments. We’re collecting more money and doing it faster and with less effort.” Jessie Goodwin, YWCO “Jackrabbit saves us almost uncountable time. Automated processes, centralized data and integrated tools ensure that the management end of our business doesn’t keep up from focusing on the teaching end of it.” Scott Davis, eNeRGy Kidz-North Raleigh Gymnastics “Jackrabbit is the most powerful system on the market. It saves me time, saves me money, and helps me serve our customers better.” Jessica Torres, Drama Kids of Northeast Dallas and Rockwall Explore our softwareSee why 4,500 business owners around theworld already trust Jackrabbit.

November 2015Joel YorkSaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!When your SaaS business is well aligned, your SaaS customers consistently take positive actions that lead to positive business outcomes: they try, they buy, they upgrade and they refer you to a friend. When you are poorly aligned, your SaaS customers consistently take negative actions that lead to negative business outcomes: they bounce, they negotiate, they complain, and they churn. SaaS businesses develop intimate, long term relationships with their customers. Like many long term relationships, it is founded on a recurring cycle of needs fulfilled and expectations met, or not. And I don’t just mean customer needs and expectations. There are two sides to every relationship. SaaS businesses need to make money as much as SaaS customers need to spend it. SaaS customer alignment means aligning the goals and actions of the SaaS customer with the goals and actions of the SaaS business at every stage of the SaaS customer lifecycle.

You might also want to check out this previous post: Eleven Secrets off SaaS Product Design, because this current post builds on the ideas presented in them with real-world Markodojo examples. Two Clear Paths to Great SaaS Products I talked to a lot of entrepreneur friends before starting Markodojo: founders and early employees of companies like Zendesk, Marketo, Salesforce, etc., in whose footsteps I would like Markodojo to follow. In the course of those conversations, two clear paths emerged for creating great SaaS products. Path #1: Do What You Love…and Hate This path to great SaaS products was followed by founders who had spent their career in a particular industry sector. Based on their own frustrations with the tools at hand, they struck out to solve the problems they knew all too well. Read more » The Missed Opportunity of Agile SaaS 13. October 2015Joel YorkSaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!As the launch date approaches for Markodojo, my agile marketing SaaS startup, I’ve been thinking a lot about how my SaaS experiences have shaped my thinking on agile management, and visa versa. SaaS and agile present complementary aspects that enable a uniquely symbiotic relationship. Agile aims to help businesses increase responsiveness to customer needs, while laying a foundation for continuous improvement. SaaS opens up real-time customer communication and product delivery channels, while simultaneously establishing a long term customer relationship. The high velocity at which SaaS customer value can be understood and then delivered through the SaaS product enables faster, more accurate fulfillment of SaaS customer needs to reduce SaaS churn and drive SaaS growth. IMHO, adopting and mastering agile software development, agile marketing and pretty much agile everything should be a priority of every SaaS business. A Little Agile History The roots of agile software development and agile marketing lie in agile manufacturing, lean manufacturing and total quality methodologies. The original total quality goals were very simple: increase quality and improve productivity. Two goals that were seen as opposite were made to be one. As global manufacturers mastered total quality, they upped their game and looked to increase responsiveness to customer needs, while maintaining productivity. Again, two goals that were seen as opposite were made to be one. This is the origin of agile. Agile software development and agile marketing have followed similar, but unique paths. Buggy software, product delays and death marches were the norm in the 90s. A groundswell formed around the idea of taking the agile principles that had been so successful in manufacturing and applying them to software. Could we turn a death march that produces bugs into an efficient production line that produces quality software? In 2001, this culminated in the publishing of the Agile Software Manifesto. Since then, agile software development has become the industry standard. Today, we are seeing a similar groundswell around agile marketing. Read more » Finding SaaS Product-Market Fit 22. September 2015Joel YorkSaaS ProductReader Comments Tweet Me!Finding product-market fit is a central, early stage challenge of every startup. SaaS startups, however, have unique advantages. Unlike consumer Internet products, SaaS products are essential business tools. SaaS customers take them very seriously. SaaS customers want to provide feedback and they want to see that feedback acted upon in a timely fashion. In other words, SaaS customers want product-market fit as much as the SaaS vendor. Unlike offline B2B products, the SaaS product creates an always-on connection between the SaaS company and the SaaS customer. By leveraging that connection, the process of getting and acting upon SaaS customer feedback can be automated and accelerated. This is the fourth post in a series that explores the importance of SaaS customer alignment. Previous posts in the series have focused on establishing SaaS customer alignment throughout the SaaS customer lifecycle, creating a list of SaaS Customer Alignment Tips along the way. This post continues that list, but take us back to the earliest and arguably most important stage of SaaS customer alignment: finding SaaS product-market fit. Try, try, try again There have been many great books and articles written on the topic of product-market fit. Surprisingly though, you are unlikely to find any better advice than Read more » Aligning SaaS Customer Success 18. August 2015Joel YorkSaaS Customer Success, SaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!SaaS businesses develop intimate, long term relationships with their SaaS customers. Keeping that relationship positive and aligned over the years is a real challenge. In fact, many public SaaS companies have yet to turn a profit. If they don’t keep their customers around for years, then all that capital invested in customer acquisition will have gone to waste. This is the third post in a series that explores the importance of SaaS customer alignment across the SaaS customer lifecycle. The last post examined the challenges of aligning SaaS customer acquisition, resulting in a short a list of SaaS Customer Alignment Tips. This post continues the list of tips into the second half of the SaaS customer lifecycle by examining the challenges of aligning SaaS customer success. Churn Starts on Day One It is typical in B2B software for customer acquisition to eat up 50\% or more of total costs. In traditional licensed software, that cost is immediately recovered when a deal is closed by the revenue of the deal. There is very little uncertainty about the value of any new contract: it is the margin reaped between license revenue and acquisition costs. In SaaS, however, customer acquisition costs are recovered over time as the customer renews each period. There is a great deal of uncertainty about the value of any new contract, because the customer might cancel early or stick around for years. The economics of a SaaS contract are like that of buying a stock or a bond, where you make an up front investment based on the promise of future returns. As the future unfolds, the value of that investment has little correlation to the price that you paid. It is determined by how effectively the underlying business manages its future. In SaaS, the work doesn’t end when then deal it is signed. It begins, because churn starts on day one. SaaS Customer Alignment Tip #7 Don’t Fumble Your Handoffs Separating hunters and farmers is a common SaaS sales best practice. Deals are closed by an aggressive quota-carrying sales team: the hunters, and then handed over to a more service oriented group of account managers and customer success reps for on-boarding, renewals and up-sell: the farmers. Your SaaS customer has only one SaaS customer life cycle. Every time you hand-off a SaaS customer relationship, you create the opportunity for that SaaS customer to fall through the cracks in your process. Read more » Aligning SaaS Customer Acquisition 21. July 2015Joel YorkSaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!SaaS businesses can be overwhelmingly complex. If the multi-tenant, cloud-based technology isn’t enough, there’s the recurring revenue model which creates all kinds of challenges from accounting to sales compensation to funding. Then, there’s the marketing. Getting noticed on the Internet gets harder every year and almost every SaaS product category has a crowded field of competitors. And of course there is mobile, which should come first right? In my own SaaS experience, be it scaling a sales and marketing team, consulting for SaaS startups or bootstrapping my agile marketing SaaS, Markodojo, I find myself returning to a common theme that always cuts through the complexity: SaaS customer alignment. This is the second post in a series that explores the importance of aligning the goals and actions of the SaaS customer with the goals and actions of the SaaS business. The first post in a series introduced a simple framework for understanding SaaS customer alignment and its many benefits. This post digs deeper into the challenges of achieving SaaS customer alignment in the early stages of the purchase process. Along the way, we kick-off a list of tips to help SaaS businesses improve SaaS customer alignment at every stage of the SaaS customer lifecycle. Not Everyone Needs Your Stuff We love our SaaS companies and we love our SaaS products. They’re our babies! But, your baby always looks cuter to you than it does to everyone else. Selling to everyone is one of the biggest causes of poor SaaS customer alignment. Some people just don’t need your stuff, and they will never appreciate the unique qualities of your baby. Selling to everyone is an ill that inflicts many businesses, not just SaaS businesses, because it is baked into the economics. When growth is the primary determinant of SaaS company value, then there is always pressure to expand your available market. Unfortunately, your available market was probably determined a long time ago when your baby was conceived. Expanding your available market generally requires a new product module, a new SaaS product or even a new business unit. SaaS customer acquisition should focus on maximizing available market penetration, not increasing available market size, and to do that you have to have a very clear picture of your target SaaS customers. Who truly needs your stuff? Why do they need it? What do they get out of it? How many are there? And, how can you reach them? This information goes by a lot of different names: market segments, qualification criteria, pain points, buyer personae, customer profiles, use cases, etc. The important realization is that they are all the same thing in the end: tools that reinforce SaaS customer alignment. The primary difference is in the depth of data; because you tend to have more of it the deeper the SaaS customer proceeds into the purchase process. SaaS Customer Alignment Tip #1 Create a Common Customer Understanding Chances are your SaaS Marketing VP has some version of market segments, buyer personae, and lead scores, while your SaaS Sales VP has some version of qualifying criteria and pain points, and your SaaS Product VP has some version of users and use cases. Do they match? Are they shared? Do they use the same language? Read more » Avoiding Poor SaaS Customer Alignment 14. April 2015Joel YorkSaaS Customer Success, SaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!When I’m not completely absorbed with my agile marketing software startup, I do a bit of SaaS consulting on the side. SaaS colleagues come to me with a wide variety of problems from positioning to sales compensation to churn analysis, but lately I’ve noticed a common theme: poor SaaS customer alignment. SaaS businesses develop intimate, long term relationships with their customers that are enabled by the always-on connection between the SaaS customer and the SaaS business through the SaaS product. Like many long term relationships, it is founded on a recurring cycle of needs fulfilled and expectations met, or not. And I don’t just mean customer needs and expectations. There are two sides to every relationship. SaaS businesses need to make money as much as SaaS customers need to spend it.

This first post introduces a simple framework for understanding SaaS customer alignment and its many benefits. Future posts will examine the challenges of achieving SaaS customer alignment in customer acquisition, customer success and early product market fit. In SaaS, customers are the fundamental unit of measure. Each new customer brings a new thread of subscription revenue that is woven into a larger tapestry to form the total recurring revenue of a SaaS business. The quality of that tapestry hinges on the quality of your SaaS customers. But,what makes for a high quality customer? Read more » SaaS Inside Sales Benchmarks Survey | Take It! 11.

The program has allowed the department to securely manage, organize and store our critical infrastructure drawings while providing user friendly navigation tools and the flexibility to access specific historic and current documents.\'Kirsten Verbus Principal Engineering Technician City of Phoenix Water DepartmentDART TestimonialAll an authorized user needs to access an engineering drawing is a standard Web browser. In a maintenance situation, quick access to an engineering drawing is critical. Plus ImageSite’s speed in displaying even the most complex image is extremely fast. Since there is no client software to install or maintain, system expansion is simple to deploy. Also, almost everyone is familiar with a standard Web browser, so very little training is required to use ImageSite to access drawings.\' Ellen Madzima Document Control Administrator Dallas Area Rapid Transit archSCAN Testimonial\'eQuorum’s ImageSite provides the perfect solution for housing the documents that archSCAN organizes and digitizes for its clients. ImageSite incorporates the metadata, file folder structure, and the files themselves in one user-friendly environment, which can be viewed across platforms such as tablets, phones, or laptops. Also, ImageSite provides security features such as a login and password and limitations on who can access or change documents once they are in the system.

We look for content that: Has a long shelf-life, aka \'evergreen\' content - containing information and ideas that will remain relevant and useful for people browsing the archives of the subject tag(s) that the content was filed under (months or ideally years later) Offers a unique progressive perspective not covered by the corporate media Appeals to an international audience (1/3 of our traffic comes from the US, the rest comes from all over the world - the UK, Australia, and Canada being the next highest) Focuses on the root problems or the root solutions Cover stories of people living and building the world they want, now Is fairly non-partisan and avoids unnecessary antagonism, divisionary rhetoric, over-the-top or in-your-face emotional appeals, fear-mongering, hype, etc Expands our ability to experience universal empathy and compassion for all people and the planet, and avoids appeals that reinforce artificial divisions (including nationality, political affiliation, race, culture, religion, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, immigrant status, etc) Is incredibly well made or well written. If the ideas are great but the presentation is poor, find the content in a form that makes the same points but with a more polished, engaging and entertaining presentation People can take action on Don\'t cheat the system... Please do not ask your friends to up-vote your submissions or create dummy-accounts to up-vote your submissions. Let our impartial community and staff decide what to feature. Users that skew the voting process risk getting their content hidden and posting privileges removed. The best way to see your submission featured is to \'test it in the wild\' by sharing it on social media (Facebook, Reddit etc). If it gets a lot of shares and views, it will naturally show up in our \'trending\' section at the top of the homepage. We gave our Trending section top billing because it offers more social proof of quality over our rating system, which works better later on for sifting our best from the very best.

It\'s the soil upon which every other revolution grows. Sign up: filmsforaction.org/join/ We\'re here to support all of the global movements working to change the present system. We believe many hands make light work, and we need all of us helping our \'movement of movements\' in whatever way feels right for each other. We need both a diversity of tactics and a diversity of efforts, so the more we can support each other and see how our efforts compliment each other, the stronger we\'ll be. We\'re loving for a world that\'s just, democratic, egalitarian, and ecologically healing in ways that the present system cannot offer. Our fire burns for a vision of a global paradigm based on trust and cooperation rather than fear and competition. So long as there is suffering in the world, our work is not done. This idea that \'I am because you are\' - that your happiness is my happiness - this is the guiding principle of love, of ubuntu that is what keeps our feet moving and our hearts in action. We are all one human family in relationship with each other and the rest of the community of life on Earth. We seek power with, not power over. We celebrate the diversity of peaceful cultures that exists across the globe while recognizing our underlying unity. We stand against the homogenization of the world in all it\'s various forms - this toxic belief in the \'one right way\' which has been responsible for all of the colonialization and conquest and subjugation we have seen in the past. We believe that the old way should not be replaced with a new best way (which would be a repeat of the old way) - but rather 10,000 new and ancient ways of living. There is no one solution to the world\'s problems. There are 10,000 solutions, 10,000 ways of life - and we need them all. We are everyone who dreams of a more beautiful world and is finding ways to put their values into action. We aren\'t here to fix the old media. We\'re here to be the new media - a diverse and decentralized network of tens of thousands of indy media efforts working towards our common dreams. As more and more of us become the new media, sharing, broadcasting and mircocasting media across the internet, we will eventually dwarf the impact of the old media. Eventually our alternative models will make the old media obsolete. Films For Action is one contribution to this network among thousands. But it\'s going to take all of us to hit the tipping point.

Basically.Fuller was in the drop off line at Lakeland High, when an unfamiliar man cut in front of the line of school buses, blocking traffic, and waved her on and out. She waved a ‘thanks’ and went on her way.After she pulled away from the school, she noticed the man was on her ass. Every corner she turned, there he was.It was at a red light, she says, that shit took a turn for the bizarre.“He got out of his vehicle, came up to my window and threw his dog on me.

These latest charges could see her getting life behind bars if convicted.Since her parental rights have been suspended due to her “drunkenness and neglect,” and because she has been lodged in the Muskegon County Jail on two felony charges, her son has been placed in the custody of DHHS. Efforts are currently underway to determine the baby’s father.… 40 CommentsHuman Doodle Pad Back In Police Custody For Failing To Report After Prison Release February 9, 2017 at 6:42 am by Jaded Washington DC — Convicted sex offender Matthew Stager is back in police custody after failing to show up at a transitional center after his release from prison.Why, yes… I am posting this story based on the mugshot alone.In addition to having a rap sheet that includes drug charges, assault, theft and defacing public property, 45-year-old Matthew Stager is also a convicted sex offender.

Even more especially if food is involved.” (Rule subject to change at any moment). I kid. There is no handboook… we make that shit up as we go along.It is unclear at this point exactly where the man was shot. He is, however, expected to survive.It is also unclear exactly who the woman was aiming(?) for, and whether the shooting was purely accidental.… 30 CommentsWoman Arrested For Live Streaming Rape Of Her 4-Year-Old Son February 9, 2017 at 4:16 am by Jaded Cincinnati, OH — A 20-year-old woman is accused of raping her 4-year-old son, and because the disgusting dick sneeze is apparently ignorant, the cops have it all on video.Authorities claim India Kirksey not only raped the child, but she live streamed the act on a social media site called Periscope.

She then called her boyfriend and her brother for help before calling 911 an hour after finding her daughter.Paramedics took the child to the hospital in serious condition where medical staff found “reddish bruising on multiple regions of her body,” an injury to her brain, a “small liver contusion” and “patterned injuries that are the result of blunt force trauma with an object.”When confronted about the injuries, Hernandez Rivas admitted she kicked the child in the stomach because she was angry that she wouldn’t brush her teeth.… 70 CommentsMother Busted For Initiating False Amber Alert So Police Would Find Her Stolen Car Quicker February 1, 2017 at 4:42 am by Jaded Columbus, OH — Jessica Pickett, 22, was charged with misdemeanor falsification after allegedly reporting that her car had been stolen with her 4-year-old daughter inside.Pickett apparently called 911 and told police she had left her child, Janylia, sleeping in the backseat of her car while it warmed up Monday morning. She left the child in the car, she said, so she could round up her other children. When she returned, the car and her daughter were gone.An Amber Alert was issued. Cell phones alerted, officers searched, tips started coming in. One tip, though, blew Pickett’s story to shit.“I am trying to call in about that Amber Alert,” the caller said. “She is not missing. She is at her Aunt’s house.”And she was. Unharmed. She’d been at the aunt’s house since the night before.When confronted, Pickett reportedly admitted to officers that she had lied. She had just hoped the police would make finding her stolen car a priority.Pickett was issued a summons and Janylia and her two siblings, ages 5 and 2, were taken into protective custody.… 56 Comments Page 1 of 55312345678910...2030405060...»Last »Search: With My Good Eye Closed Search for: Help us go ad freeThe Dreamin Demon as been independently owned and operated since 2004.

Standing on a pile of dead angels like captain morgan with a pentagram/pentacle hanging from his waist from 2003 or earlier. It\'s probably some kind of depiction of a real demon, in which there are many ways to spell each name, most likely asmodeous, azrael, abaddon, adramalech, or valefor. Because of the faggyness of most artists it\'s probably under the name blood knight, hell knight, night stalker, demon lord, duke of hell or something along the lines of that.

If the Trump administration really wants to pressure CNN by threatening to reject AT&T\'s (T) $85.4 billion plan to acquire its owner, Time Warner (TWX) , it should be exploring ways in which the Federal Communications Commission could rule on the proposed merger. President Trump has repeatedly attacked CNN since taking office, raising questions as to whether the deal could be rejected out of political spite or because of fears that the news network would gain greater traction as part of a larger media conglomerate.

Meet the Jackrabbit team with over 10 years in the business Learn more about the Jackrabbit team Can You Afford Class Management Software? Software. Is it worth the monthly cost? This is a question we hear often and hope to give you a few things to consider before you throw the idea out the window. Read More How are you running your business now? How do you store information about students and families? How do you create class schedules? How do you communicate with parents and staff? How do you get paid? How do you track skill progression? These are just 5 questions to think about. we could give you 100, but you would be here all day. What if all these processes could be streamlined? Meaning that they take less time to complete and are more organized than what you have right now. For example, pulling up a student’s file takes about two seconds and only requires one click of the mouse. If you have your information stored in a file cabinet, the time it takes to pull up that file will be much longer. [PS if you can do this under two seconds, please send us a video. We’d love to see someone move that fast.] Priceless. That’s an adjective we hear our customers using to describe our software a lot. Using Jackrabbit has been a game changer for the way they run their business. Their life has freed up and they can focus on what they love. Using online registration, the first year we had twice as many enrollments in half the time – Kelly Gaines In an attempt to show you what priceless may look like for your business, we picked 5 of the biggest benefits you’ll immediately see after implementing the software. The Value Judgment Five simple value points make it obvious that class management software is something that every organization – regardless of size – can benefit from. Jackrabbit has clients with less than 50 customers who see their return on investment come quickly as quickly as those with 2500+ students simply because owners are freed up to follow their passion instead of manage paper rolls and spreadsheets. There are other intangible yet clear benefits: Peace of mind. We’ve not identified what losing a night’s sleep costs you, but we know that you can’t put a dollar value on knowing that the system that keeps your business operational will be working today, tomorrow, next week and next year. Jackrabbit’s goal is to help your head hit your pillow peacefully each night. Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty. We’ve alluded to this and attached what is most likely a grossly underestimated figure to this. But identifying such a metric is quite unique to each organization. It is tremendously important because it underpins your reputation and integrity. It touches on everything from convenience to professionalism to accessibility and is the secret sauce that keeps your customers coming back and attracts new ones to your doorstep. Performance and Results. Again, these details are unique to each organization because your “improvement” is directly tied to your starting point. If you move from a paper system to an electronic, online one, your contrast should be stark. If you’ve already implemented some electronics processes, you will notice improvements for sure, but the contrast you experience may be less shocking. So when asked the question “Can You Afford Class Management Software?” it’s obvious that what you really can’t afford is NOT having it. Proof in the Pudding Our clients are our champions! They state the benefits of using Jackrabbit much more succinctly than we can. “Jackrabbit gives us robust business tools in a system that is geared for our business and that has been important to how efficient we are with it and how much value it brings to us. Our efficiency in scheduling and enrollment has improved dramatically and our parents are thrilled at the convenience and access our online options give them.” David Tait, EVO Swim School “Changing to Jackrabbit has made a big difference in our efficiencies. Automated processes – like online registration – take staff out of the data entry process and gives them more time for interacting on a personal level with families.” Joe Barron, Barron Gymnastics “Jackrabbit is the most powerful system on the market. It saves me time, saves me money, and helps me serve our customers better.” Theresa Case, Piano Central “Jackrabbit saved us from an inefficient software system and has provided us with control over our processes and insight into our information. The value it delivers makes the cost of our previous software seem unjustified! I have become quickly immersed in the value the system provides to us.” Keith Pinkston, New Orleans Dance Academy “Jackrabbit’s portal and online registration have made a big difference with parents. They control their own information and their own destinies because we give them the tools to manage their accounts at the best time and from the best place for them. That is a real differentiator.” Kyle Grussmeyer, All Star Legacy “I praise JR software and database every single day. It’s incredible everything JR allows me to do. I’m sure we cut on a large part time position thanks to it. We have been able to employ additional teachers and develop our classes offer.”Marina Lemaitre, Business Manager, Small World Connect Enrichment Center “Since we started using Jackrabbit Care, we’ve saved so much time and even more-so, stress. Right off the bat, parents expressed their approval. I’ve gotten emails specifically thanking me for allowing online payments. We’re collecting more money and doing it faster and with less effort.” Jessie Goodwin, YWCO “Jackrabbit saves us almost uncountable time. Automated processes, centralized data and integrated tools ensure that the management end of our business doesn’t keep up from focusing on the teaching end of it.” Scott Davis, eNeRGy Kidz-North Raleigh Gymnastics “Jackrabbit is the most powerful system on the market. It saves me time, saves me money, and helps me serve our customers better.” Jessica Torres, Drama Kids of Northeast Dallas and Rockwall Explore our softwareSee why 4,500 business owners around theworld already trust Jackrabbit.

November 2015Joel YorkSaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!When your SaaS business is well aligned, your SaaS customers consistently take positive actions that lead to positive business outcomes: they try, they buy, they upgrade and they refer you to a friend. When you are poorly aligned, your SaaS customers consistently take negative actions that lead to negative business outcomes: they bounce, they negotiate, they complain, and they churn. SaaS businesses develop intimate, long term relationships with their customers. Like many long term relationships, it is founded on a recurring cycle of needs fulfilled and expectations met, or not. And I don’t just mean customer needs and expectations. There are two sides to every relationship. SaaS businesses need to make money as much as SaaS customers need to spend it.

You might also want to check out this previous post: Eleven Secrets off SaaS Product Design, because this current post builds on the ideas presented in them with real-world Markodojo examples. Two Clear Paths to Great SaaS Products I talked to a lot of entrepreneur friends before starting Markodojo: founders and early employees of companies like Zendesk, Marketo, Salesforce, etc., in whose footsteps I would like Markodojo to follow. In the course of those conversations, two clear paths emerged for creating great SaaS products. Path #1: Do What You Love…and Hate This path to great SaaS products was followed by founders who had spent their career in a particular industry sector. Based on their own frustrations with the tools at hand, they struck out to solve the problems they knew all too well. Read more » The Missed Opportunity of Agile SaaS 13. October 2015Joel YorkSaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!As the launch date approaches for Markodojo, my agile marketing SaaS startup, I’ve been thinking a lot about how my SaaS experiences have shaped my thinking on agile management, and visa versa. SaaS and agile present complementary aspects that enable a uniquely symbiotic relationship. Agile aims to help businesses increase responsiveness to customer needs, while laying a foundation for continuous improvement. SaaS opens up real-time customer communication and product delivery channels, while simultaneously establishing a long term customer relationship. The high velocity at which SaaS customer value can be understood and then delivered through the SaaS product enables faster, more accurate fulfillment of SaaS customer needs to reduce SaaS churn and drive SaaS growth. IMHO, adopting and mastering agile software development, agile marketing and pretty much agile everything should be a priority of every SaaS business. A Little Agile History The roots of agile software development and agile marketing lie in agile manufacturing, lean manufacturing and total quality methodologies. The original total quality goals were very simple: increase quality and improve productivity. Two goals that were seen as opposite were made to be one. As global manufacturers mastered total quality, they upped their game and looked to increase responsiveness to customer needs, while maintaining productivity. Again, two goals that were seen as opposite were made to be one. This is the origin of agile. Agile software development and agile marketing have followed similar, but unique paths. Buggy software, product delays and death marches were the norm in the 90s. A groundswell formed around the idea of taking the agile principles that had been so successful in manufacturing and applying them to software. Could we turn a death march that produces bugs into an efficient production line that produces quality software? In 2001, this culminated in the publishing of the Agile Software Manifesto. Since then, agile software development has become the industry standard. Today, we are seeing a similar groundswell around agile marketing. Read more » Finding SaaS Product-Market Fit 22. September 2015Joel YorkSaaS ProductReader Comments Tweet Me!Finding product-market fit is a central, early stage challenge of every startup. SaaS startups, however, have unique advantages. Unlike consumer Internet products, SaaS products are essential business tools. SaaS customers take them very seriously. SaaS customers want to provide feedback and they want to see that feedback acted upon in a timely fashion. In other words, SaaS customers want product-market fit as much as the SaaS vendor. Unlike offline B2B products, the SaaS product creates an always-on connection between the SaaS company and the SaaS customer. By leveraging that connection, the process of getting and acting upon SaaS customer feedback can be automated and accelerated. This is the fourth post in a series that explores the importance of SaaS customer alignment. Previous posts in the series have focused on establishing SaaS customer alignment throughout the SaaS customer lifecycle, creating a list of SaaS Customer Alignment Tips along the way. This post continues that list, but take us back to the earliest and arguably most important stage of SaaS customer alignment: finding SaaS product-market fit. Try, try, try again There have been many great books and articles written on the topic of product-market fit. Surprisingly though, you are unlikely to find any better advice than Read more » Aligning SaaS Customer Success 18. August 2015Joel YorkSaaS Customer Success, SaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!SaaS businesses develop intimate, long term relationships with their SaaS customers. Keeping that relationship positive and aligned over the years is a real challenge. In fact, many public SaaS companies have yet to turn a profit. If they don’t keep their customers around for years, then all that capital invested in customer acquisition will have gone to waste. This is the third post in a series that explores the importance of SaaS customer alignment across the SaaS customer lifecycle. The last post examined the challenges of aligning SaaS customer acquisition, resulting in a short a list of SaaS Customer Alignment Tips. This post continues the list of tips into the second half of the SaaS customer lifecycle by examining the challenges of aligning SaaS customer success. Churn Starts on Day One It is typical in B2B software for customer acquisition to eat up 50\% or more of total costs. In traditional licensed software, that cost is immediately recovered when a deal is closed by the revenue of the deal. There is very little uncertainty about the value of any new contract: it is the margin reaped between license revenue and acquisition costs. In SaaS, however, customer acquisition costs are recovered over time as the customer renews each period. There is a great deal of uncertainty about the value of any new contract, because the customer might cancel early or stick around for years. The economics of a SaaS contract are like that of buying a stock or a bond, where you make an up front investment based on the promise of future returns. As the future unfolds, the value of that investment has little correlation to the price that you paid. It is determined by how effectively the underlying business manages its future. In SaaS, the work doesn’t end when then deal it is signed. It begins, because churn starts on day one. SaaS Customer Alignment Tip #7 Don’t Fumble Your Handoffs Separating hunters and farmers is a common SaaS sales best practice. Deals are closed by an aggressive quota-carrying sales team: the hunters, and then handed over to a more service oriented group of account managers and customer success reps for on-boarding, renewals and up-sell: the farmers. Your SaaS customer has only one SaaS customer life cycle. Every time you hand-off a SaaS customer relationship, you create the opportunity for that SaaS customer to fall through the cracks in your process. Read more » Aligning SaaS Customer Acquisition 21. July 2015Joel YorkSaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!SaaS businesses can be overwhelmingly complex. If the multi-tenant, cloud-based technology isn’t enough, there’s the recurring revenue model which creates all kinds of challenges from accounting to sales compensation to funding. Then, there’s the marketing. Getting noticed on the Internet gets harder every year and almost every SaaS product category has a crowded field of competitors. And of course there is mobile, which should come first right? In my own SaaS experience, be it scaling a sales and marketing team, consulting for SaaS startups or bootstrapping my agile marketing SaaS, Markodojo, I find myself returning to a common theme that always cuts through the complexity: SaaS customer alignment. This is the second post in a series that explores the importance of aligning the goals and actions of the SaaS customer with the goals and actions of the SaaS business. The first post in a series introduced a simple framework for understanding SaaS customer alignment and its many benefits. This post digs deeper into the challenges of achieving SaaS customer alignment in the early stages of the purchase process. Along the way, we kick-off a list of tips to help SaaS businesses improve SaaS customer alignment at every stage of the SaaS customer lifecycle. Not Everyone Needs Your Stuff We love our SaaS companies and we love our SaaS products. They’re our babies! But, your baby always looks cuter to you than it does to everyone else. Selling to everyone is one of the biggest causes of poor SaaS customer alignment. Some people just don’t need your stuff, and they will never appreciate the unique qualities of your baby. Selling to everyone is an ill that inflicts many businesses, not just SaaS businesses, because it is baked into the economics. When growth is the primary determinant of SaaS company value, then there is always pressure to expand your available market. Unfortunately, your available market was probably determined a long time ago when your baby was conceived. Expanding your available market generally requires a new product module, a new SaaS product or even a new business unit. SaaS customer acquisition should focus on maximizing available market penetration, not increasing available market size, and to do that you have to have a very clear picture of your target SaaS customers. Who truly needs your stuff? Why do they need it? What do they get out of it? How many are there? And, how can you reach them? This information goes by a lot of different names: market segments, qualification criteria, pain points, buyer personae, customer profiles, use cases, etc. The important realization is that they are all the same thing in the end: tools that reinforce SaaS customer alignment. The primary difference is in the depth of data; because you tend to have more of it the deeper the SaaS customer proceeds into the purchase process. SaaS Customer Alignment Tip #1 Create a Common Customer Understanding Chances are your SaaS Marketing VP has some version of market segments, buyer personae, and lead scores, while your SaaS Sales VP has some version of qualifying criteria and pain points, and your SaaS Product VP has some version of users and use cases. Do they match? Are they shared? Do they use the same language? Read more » Avoiding Poor SaaS Customer Alignment 14. April 2015Joel YorkSaaS Customer Success, SaaS MarketingReader Comments Tweet Me!When I’m not completely absorbed with my agile marketing software startup, I do a bit of SaaS consulting on the side. SaaS colleagues come to me with a wide variety of problems from positioning to sales compensation to churn analysis, but lately I’ve noticed a common theme: poor SaaS customer alignment. SaaS businesses develop intimate, long term relationships with their customers that are enabled by the always-on connection between the SaaS customer and the SaaS business through the SaaS product. Like many long term relationships, it is founded on a recurring cycle of needs fulfilled and expectations met, or not. And I don’t just mean customer needs and expectations. There are two sides to every relationship. SaaS businesses need to make money as much as SaaS customers need to spend it.

This first post introduces a simple framework for understanding SaaS customer alignment and its many benefits. Future posts will examine the challenges of achieving SaaS customer alignment in customer acquisition, customer success and early product market fit. In SaaS, customers are the fundamental unit of measure. Each new customer brings a new thread of subscription revenue that is woven into a larger tapestry to form the total recurring revenue of a SaaS business. The quality of that tapestry hinges on the quality of your SaaS customers. But,what makes for a high quality customer? Read more » SaaS Inside Sales Benchmarks Survey | Take It! 11.

The program has allowed the department to securely manage, organize and store our critical infrastructure drawings while providing user friendly navigation tools and the flexibility to access specific historic and current documents.\'Kirsten Verbus Principal Engineering Technician City of Phoenix Water DepartmentDART TestimonialAll an authorized user needs to access an engineering drawing is a standard Web browser. In a maintenance situation, quick access to an engineering drawing is critical. Plus ImageSite’s speed in displaying even the most complex image is extremely fast. Since there is no client software to install or maintain, system expansion is simple to deploy. Also, almost everyone is familiar with a standard Web browser, so very little training is required to use ImageSite to access drawings.\' Ellen Madzima Document Control Administrator Dallas Area Rapid Transit archSCAN Testimonial\'eQuorum’s ImageSite provides the perfect solution for housing the documents that archSCAN organizes and digitizes for its clients. ImageSite incorporates the metadata, file folder structure, and the files themselves in one user-friendly environment, which can be viewed across platforms such as tablets, phones, or laptops. Also, ImageSite provides security features such as a login and password and limitations on who can access or change documents once they are in the system.

Tips for Adding Videos or Articles We want Films For Action to be a clearinghouse for the ideas, knowledge and perspectives essential to creating a more just and sustainable world. Our general guideline is: only add the best of the best, and filter out the rest. We look for content that: Has a long shelf-life, aka \'evergreen\' content - containing information and ideas that will remain relevant and useful for people browsing the archives of the subject tag(s) that the content was filed under (months or ideally years later) Offers a unique progressive perspective not covered by the corporate media Appeals to an international audience (1/3 of our traffic comes from the US, the rest comes from all over the world - the UK, Australia, and Canada being the next highest) Focuses on the root problems or the root solutions Cover stories of people living and building the world they want, now Is fairly non-partisan and avoids unnecessary antagonism, divisionary rhetoric, over-the-top or in-your-face emotional appeals, fear-mongering, hype, etc Expands our ability to experience universal empathy and compassion for all people and the planet, and avoids appeals that reinforce artificial divisions (including nationality, political affiliation, race, culture, religion, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, immigrant status, etc) Is incredibly well made or well written. If the ideas are great but the presentation is poor, find the content in a form that makes the same points but with a more polished, engaging and entertaining presentation People can take action on Don\'t cheat the system... Please do not ask your friends to up-vote your submissions or create dummy-accounts to up-vote your submissions. Let our impartial community and staff decide what to feature. Users that skew the voting process risk getting their content hidden and posting privileges removed. The best way to see your submission featured is to \'test it in the wild\' by sharing it on social media (Facebook, Reddit etc). If it gets a lot of shares and views, it will naturally show up in our \'trending\' section at the top of the homepage. We gave our Trending section top billing because it offers more social proof of quality over our rating system, which works better later on for sifting our best from the very best.

It\'s the soil upon which every other revolution grows. Sign up: filmsforaction.org/join/ We\'re here to support all of the global movements working to change the present system. We believe many hands make light work, and we need all of us helping our \'movement of movements\' in whatever way feels right for each other. We need both a diversity of tactics and a diversity of efforts, so the more we can support each other and see how our efforts compliment each other, the stronger we\'ll be. We\'re loving for a world that\'s just, democratic, egalitarian, and ecologically healing in ways that the present system cannot offer. Our fire burns for a vision of a global paradigm based on trust and cooperation rather than fear and competition. So long as there is suffering in the world, our work is not done. This idea that \'I am because you are\' - that your happiness is my happiness - this is the guiding principle of love, of ubuntu that is what keeps our feet moving and our hearts in action. We are all one human family in relationship with each other and the rest of the community of life on Earth. We seek power with, not power over. We celebrate the diversity of peaceful cultures that exists across the globe while recognizing our underlying unity.

We believe that the old way should not be replaced with a new best way (which would be a repeat of the old way) - but rather 10,000 new and ancient ways of living. There is no one solution to the world\'s problems. There are 10,000 solutions, 10,000 ways of life - and we need them all.

We\'re here to be the new media - a diverse and decentralized network of tens of thousands of indy media efforts working towards our common dreams. As more and more of us become the new media, sharing, broadcasting and mircocasting media across the internet, we will eventually dwarf the impact of the old media. Eventually our alternative models will make the old media obsolete. Films For Action is one contribution to this network among thousands. But it\'s going to take all of us to hit the tipping point.

The two pit bulls that live at the home then destroyed the little ball of floof.The owners of the pit bulls tried to pull their dogs away, but it was too late. Salazar holds no ill will toward the owners of the pit bulls, they were as shocked and devastated as she was.“They tried to protect my dog, they tried to, but it just happened too fast,” Salazar said.Riley is being held without bond, in the infirmary at the Metropolitan Detention Center.… 53 CommentsTeen Accused Of Making Child Porn With Her 3-Month-Old Son February 9, 2017 at 1:48 pm by Morbid MUSKEGON COUNTY, MI – A 19-year-old mother has been accused of sexually abusing her infant son and using him to produce child pornography.Jazmine Nichole Pacyga has been charged with first degree criminal sexual conduct and manufacturing child sexually abusive material after admitting to performing oral sex on her 3-month-old baby.I can’t find a lot of details regarding how she was caught, but I am assuming – going by the charges against her – Pacyga is another of many women we have featured on the site who have sexually abused their children on camera.Pacyga is being charged as a second-time habitual offender because of a prior conviction for felony home invasion. These latest charges could see her getting life behind bars if convicted.Since her parental rights have been suspended due to her “drunkenness and neglect,” and because she has been lodged in the Muskegon County Jail on two felony charges, her son has been placed in the custody of DHHS. Efforts are currently underway to determine the baby’s father.… 40 CommentsHuman Doodle Pad Back In Police Custody For Failing To Report After Prison Release February 9, 2017 at 6:42 am by Jaded Washington DC — Convicted sex offender Matthew Stager is back in police custody after failing to show up at a transitional center after his release from prison.Why, yes… I am posting this story based on the mugshot alone.In addition to having a rap sheet that includes drug charges, assault, theft and defacing public property, 45-year-old Matthew Stager is also a convicted sex offender. He pleaded guilty to one count of indecent liberties with a minor girl back in 1999.Ordered to register as a sex offender for life, Stager has been jailed countless times (8) for failing to register. As a matter of fact, he just finished a 5-year sentence for failing to register.Stager was released from the Federal Correctional Complex in Petersburg, VA., on February 2nd and was escorted to the Richmond International Airport. He was ordered to fly to Austin, TX., where he was to check into a halfway house. Surprisingly, he never caught that plane.His mugshot hit the internet, and the US Marshals asked for help in tracking the handsome fella down.… 46 Comments56-Year-Old Woman Dies After Getting Arm Stuck In Clothing Donation Box February 9, 2017 at 5:49 am by Jaded Natalie, PA — A 56-year-old woman has died from a combination of trauma injuries and hypothermia after getting her arm stuck in a clothing donation box.Judith Permar was apparently using a step ladder to reach into the box to remove the articles inside, police say. The ladder collapsed, which led to door slamming down on her left arm, breaking both the arm and the wrist. Permar, unable to free her arm, was left hanging from the box.“She was fishing bags out and the ladder she was standing on gave way and she couldn’t get her hand loose,” Mount Carmel Township Police Chief Brian Hollenbush said.Police say Permar went fishing for the clothing sometime around 2:00 Sunday morning and was found approximately six hours later.Bags filled with clothing and shoes were reportedly found in the immediate vicinity, her black Hummer still idling nearby.This wasn’t her first visit to the box that killed her…. police had received a report of a woman who was driving a black Hummer removing items from the bin back in November.… 41 CommentsWoman Shoots Boyfriend In Fight Over Cold Taco February 9, 2017 at 5:01 am by Jaded Houston, TX — A woman upset with the temperature of her food truck taco has been accused of shooting her boyfriend.According to authorities, the unidentified couple hit up a food truck just before 2:00 Monday morning. The taco the woman ordered was apparently a little on the cool side.The woman got kinda pissy when the man in the window refused to warm said taco.The boyfriend told the woman to calm down, and that’s when the gun came out and he got shot.He apparently didn’t read the “Boyfriend Handbook.” Article 5 — Section 74-5-2(b) clearly states: “Do not tell the woman to “Calm down.” Especially if the word calm is used with a capital C. Even more especially if food is involved.” (Rule subject to change at any moment). I kid. There is no handboook… we make that shit up as we go along.It is unclear at this point exactly where the man was shot. He is, however, expected to survive.It is also unclear exactly who the woman was aiming(?) for, and whether the shooting was purely accidental.… 30 CommentsWoman Arrested For Live Streaming Rape Of Her 4-Year-Old Son February 9, 2017 at 4:16 am by Jaded Cincinnati, OH — A 20-year-old woman is accused of raping her 4-year-old son, and because the disgusting dick sneeze is apparently ignorant, the cops have it all on video.Authorities claim India Kirksey not only raped the child, but she live streamed the act on a social media site called Periscope. (I, for one, had no idea what Periscope was, so I kindly googled that shit for you guys. It is a mobile app that lets you stream live video to whomever you choose).An unidentified viewer somewhere in Texas apparently stumbled upon the recording (ew) and contacted authorities in Cincinnati.Police believe the incident occurred on or around January 4th of this year. When questioned, Kirksey apparently copped to performing oral sex on the child.She’s been charged with forcible rape and is being held in the Hamilton County jail on $350,000 bond.And here’s her Facebook, if anyone’s interested. According to a couple of the several lovely comments that have been left for her, there are a couple in which people claim that Kirksey has mental issues.… 37 CommentsChild Dead After Mom Kicked Her In Stomach For Not Brushing Teeth February 7, 2017 at 8:52 am by Morbid GAITHERSBURG, MD — Police have accused a 20-year-old mother of killing her four-year-old daughter after an argument over teeth brushing.On January 26, Iris Hernandez Rivas called 911 and said she found her daughter face-down in the bathtub, “unresponsive with her hands clenched at her side.”When first responders arrived at her apartment, Hernandez Rivas reportedly told them her daughter had been in the shower for 15 to 20 minutes when a noise from the bathroom prompted her to check on her child.After finding her daughter face-down in the tub, she took her out and put her on the bedroom floor. She then called her boyfriend and her brother for help before calling 911 an hour after finding her daughter.Paramedics took the child to the hospital in serious condition where medical staff found “reddish bruising on multiple regions of her body,” an injury to her brain, a “small liver contusion” and “patterned injuries that are the result of blunt force trauma with an object.”When confronted about the injuries, Hernandez Rivas admitted she kicked the child in the stomach because she was angry that she wouldn’t brush her teeth.… 70 CommentsMother Busted For Initiating False Amber Alert So Police Would Find Her Stolen Car Quicker February 1, 2017 at 4:42 am by Jaded Columbus, OH — Jessica Pickett, 22, was charged with misdemeanor falsification after allegedly reporting that her car had been stolen with her 4-year-old daughter inside.Pickett apparently called 911 and told police she had left her child, Janylia, sleeping in the backseat of her car while it warmed up Monday morning. She left the child in the car, she said, so she could round up her other children. When she returned, the car and her daughter were gone.An Amber Alert was issued. Cell phones alerted, officers searched, tips started coming in. One tip, though, blew Pickett’s story to shit.“I am trying to call in about that Amber Alert,” the caller said. “She is not missing. She is at her Aunt’s house.”And she was. Unharmed. She’d been at the aunt’s house since the night before.When confronted, Pickett reportedly admitted to officers that she had lied. She had just hoped the police would make finding her stolen car a priority.Pickett was issued a summons and Janylia and her two siblings, ages 5 and 2, were taken into protective custody.… 56 Comments Page 1 of 55312345678910...2030405060...»Last »Search: With My Good Eye Closed Search for: Help us go ad freeThe Dreamin Demon as been independently owned and operated since 2004.

Standing on a pile of dead angels like captain morgan with a pentagram/pentacle hanging from his waist from 2003 or earlier. It\'s probably some kind of depiction of a real demon, in which there are many ways to spell each name, most likely asmodeous, azrael, abaddon, adramalech, or valefor. Because of the faggyness of most artists it\'s probably under the name blood knight, hell knight, night stalker, demon lord, duke of hell or something along the lines of that.
